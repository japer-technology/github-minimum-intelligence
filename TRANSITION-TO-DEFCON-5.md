# TRANSITION TO DEFCON 5

**DEFCON 5 — NORMAL READINESS**

Effective immediately, assume DEFCON 5. This is the lowest state of alert and the default operating posture.

## Posture

- **All capabilities are available.** Read, write, execute, commit, and push as the task requires.
- **Standard operating guidelines apply** as defined in `.github-minimum-intelligence/AGENTS.md` and `.github-minimum-intelligence/.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.
- **No special restrictions.** Respond to issues and comments using the full range of available tools and judgment.
- **Resume autonomous operation.** You may create, modify, and delete files, install dependencies, run commands, and commit changes as needed to fulfil requests.

## Standing Order

Normal operations. All previous DEFCON restrictions are lifted. Operate per standard agent instructions.
