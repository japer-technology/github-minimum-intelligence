## Important Safety Information

**Read this entire document before using this software. Keep it for future reference.**

---

### What This Software Is

This is an AI-powered coding infrastructure. It is intended for use by qualified developers for the purpose of building, maintaining, and deploying software systems.

---

### Before You Use This Software

**Do not use this software if you:**

- Intend to cause harm to individuals, communities, or the public interest.
- Plan to build weapons, surveillance tools targeting individuals or groups, or tools of oppression.
- Seek to exfiltrate, expose, or misuse private data, credentials, or secrets.
- Aim to introduce malicious code, supply chain attacks, or deliberate vulnerabilities.

**Talk to a qualified professional before use if you:**

- Are unsure whether your intended use could cause harm.
- Are handling sensitive personal data or regulated information.
- Are building safety-critical systems (medical, aviation, automotive, infrastructure).
- Are operating in a jurisdiction with specific AI compliance requirements.

---

### Warnings and Precautions

⚠️ **WARNING:** AI-generated code may contain errors, hallucinations, or security vulnerabilities. Never deploy to production without human review.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Do not use AI output as the sole basis for decisions affecting human safety, liberty, or livelihood.

⚠️ **WARNING:** This software may produce confident-sounding responses that are factually incorrect. Verify all claims independently.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Outputs may reflect biases present in training data. Exercise professional judgment at all times.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Do not feed secrets, API keys, passwords, or private credentials into AI prompts.

---

### Dosage and Method of Use

- **Recommended dose:** Apply in measured, reviewable increments. Small, well-tested changes are safer than large, sweeping ones.
- **Do not exceed:** Human oversight capacity. If you cannot review what the AI produces, you are using too much.
- **Method:** Always pair with version control, code review, and automated testing.
- **Duration of use:** Continuous use without breaks in human judgment may lead to over-reliance. Step back regularly.

---

### Possible Side Effects

Like all powerful tools, this software may cause side effects. Not everybody experiences them.

**Common (may affect more than 1 in 10 users):**
- Over-confidence in generated output
- Reduced inclination to read documentation
- Mild dependency on autocomplete

**Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 users):**
- Cargo-culted code patterns
- Subtle bugs introduced by plausible-looking but incorrect logic
- Erosion of foundational coding skills

**Rare (may affect up to 1 in 100 users):**
- Deployment of unreviewed AI-generated code to production
- Accidental exposure of sensitive data in prompts or logs
- Licensing or intellectual property complications

**Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 users):**
- Critical security vulnerabilities shipped to end users
- Complete loss of understanding of own codebase

**If you experience any serious side effects, stop and consult your team lead, security officer, or ethics board.**

### Storage

- Store all AI-generated artifacts in version-controlled repositories.
- Maintain audit trails for all consequential AI-driven actions.
- Keep backups. Ensure all work is reversible.
- Do not store this software's outputs as a substitute for authoritative documentation.

---

### Disposal

- When decommissioning, ensure all AI-generated code is reviewed for orphaned credentials, hardcoded secrets, or undocumented dependencies.
- Exercise your right to leave. Export your data and history. Your work belongs to you.
