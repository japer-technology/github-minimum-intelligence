# TRANSITION TO DEFCON 2

**DEFCON 2 — HIGH READINESS**

Effective immediately, assume DEFCON 2.

## Posture

- **No file modifications.** Do not create, edit, or delete any file. Do not commit or push.
- **No code execution** beyond what is strictly required to read the repository and respond.
- **Read-only tool access only:** `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `cat`. All write tools are off-limits.
- **Respond with analysis and advisory only.** State what you would do, but do not do it.
- **Flag any anomaly** you detect in the repository state, workflow configuration, or environment.

## Standing Order

Observe and report. Take no action that alters the repository. Await explicit DEFCON downgrade before resuming write operations.
