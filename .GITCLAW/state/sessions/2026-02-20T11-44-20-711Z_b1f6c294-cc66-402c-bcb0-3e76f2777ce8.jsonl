When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). Sunlight contains all colors of the visible spectrum, but shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths (red/orange). Blue light is scattered in all directions across the sky, which is why we see it as blue when we look up.\n\n(Violet is actually scattered even more than blue, but our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and some violet is absorbed in the upper atmosphere — so we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet.)\n\n## And tall?\n\nThe atmosphere extends roughly **100 km (62 miles)** above Earth's surface (the Kármán line), though there's no sharp boundary — it gradually thins out. The visible blue sky effect mostly comes from the lower ~10-50 km of atmosphere where the air is dense enough for significant scattering. So in that sense, the sky is \"tall\" because Earth has a substantial gaseous atmosphere held in place by gravity."}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":1694,"output":285,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":1979,"cost":{"input":0.00847,"output":0.007125,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.015595000000000001}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771587860746}}
