You could exploit this by creating an issue or @mentioning someone.\n\n### 4. **Webhooks → External Service**\nConfigure a repository webhook to POST to an external service (e.g., Zapier, a Lambda function) that sends the email.\n\n### 5. **GitHub Actions + `sendmail`/`mailutils`**\nInstall and use command-line mail tools in a runner, though this is less reliable without a proper SMTP relay.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to look at this repo and help set up one of these approaches?
