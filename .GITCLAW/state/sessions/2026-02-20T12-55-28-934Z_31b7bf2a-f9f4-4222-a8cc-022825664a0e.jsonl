This is essentially leveraging GitHub as an email relay without any external services.\n\n---\n\n## How GitHub Notification Emails Work\n\nGitHub sends emails to users based on their **notification preferences** (Settings → Notifications). Emails are sent when a user is \"notified\" of an event. The key is: **what triggers a notification?**\n\n---\n\n## Angles of Attack\n\n### 1. **@Mentioning a User**\n- Mention `@username` in an issue, PR, comment, or discussion.\n- That user gets an email (if they have email notifications enabled).\n- **Pros:** Simple, targeted.\n- **Cons:** Only works for GitHub users. Content is visible publicly (unless private repo). You can't control the \"from\" or subject line fully.\n\n### 2. **Creating/Commenting on an Issue**\n- Create an issue or add a comment — all **subscribers** and **participants** get emailed.\n- You can programmatically create issues via the GitHub API or `gh` CLI in Actions:\n  ```yaml\n  - run: gh issue create --title \"Alert\" --body \"Something happened\"\n    env:\n      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  ```\n- **Angle:** The issue body *is* your email body. Markdown renders in the email.\n\n### 3. **Assigning Someone to an Issue/PR**\n- Assigning a user triggers a notification email to them.\n- Could be used to \"page\" someone.\n\n### 4. **Requesting a PR Review**\n- Requesting a review from a user sends them an email notification.\n- Could create a dummy PR and request review as a notification mechanism.\n\n### 5. **Creating a Discussion (if enabled)**\n- GitHub Discussions also trigger notification emails to watchers/participants.\n\n### 6. **Repository Watch / Release Notifications**\n- If users **watch** a repo, they get emails on new releases.\n- You could **create a release** via API/Actions to blast an email to all watchers:\n  ```yaml\n  - run: gh release create v1.0.${{ github.run_number }} --title \"Update\" --notes \"Here's your message\"\n    env:\n      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  ```\n- **Angle:** This is essentially a mailing list to anyone watching the repo.\n\n### 7. **Team Mentions (@org/team)**\n- Mentioning a team notifies all team members — a way to email a group.\n\n### 8. **Security Advisories**\n- Creating a repository security advisory notifies maintainers — niche but possible.\n\n### 9. **Automated Issue with Close/Reopen Cycle**\n- You could have a single \"notification\" issue that you comment on, then close/reopen — each state change notifies subscribers. Keeps things tidy in one thread.\n\n### 10. **Reply-To Trick**\n- GitHub notification emails include a **reply-to address**. When a recipient replies to the email, their response becomes a comment on the issue/PR. This creates a **two-way email channel** through GitHub.\n\n---\n\n## Key Constraints & Considerations\n\n| Factor | Details |\n|---|---|\n| **Audience** | Only GitHub users with email notifications enabled |\n| **Content visibility** | Visible in the repo (unless private) |\n| **Rate limits** | GitHub may throttle notifications if abused |\n| **Formatting** | Markdown in body renders as HTML in email |\n| **Subject line** | Format is `[repo] Title (#number)` — limited control |\n| **Delivery speed** | Near-instant in practice |\n| **No arbitrary recipients** | Can't email `random@example.com` — must be a GitHub user connected to the repo |\n| **Unsubscribe** | Users can unsubscribe/mute at any time |\n\n---\n\n## Most Practical Patterns\n\n- **Alert/paging system:** GitHub Action creates an issue or comment on a trigger → team gets emailed.\n- **Poor man's mailing list:** Watchers on a repo get release notification emails.\n- **Two-way comms:** Issue comments as email threads via reply-to.\n\n---\n\nWant me to prototype any of these in this repo? For example, a GitHub Action that creates an issue comment as a notification mechanism?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":2406,"output":1075,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":3481,"cost":{"input":0.01203,"output":0.026875,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.038905}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771594596293}}
