.GITCLAW is **explicitly enabled** while this file exists at:

- `.GITCLAW/.GITCLAW-ENABLED.md`

## File existence behavior

All `.GITCLAW-*` workflows run `.GITHUB-MODE/lifecycle/enabled.ts` as the first blocking guard step. If this file is missing, the guard exits non-zero and prints:

> GitClaw disabled by missing .GITCLAW-ENABLED.md

That fail-closed guard blocks all subsequent GITCLAW workflow logic.
