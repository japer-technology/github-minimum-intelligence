**DEFCON 4 — ABOVE NORMAL READINESS**

Effective immediately, assume DEFCON 4.

## Posture

- **All standard capabilities remain available**, but exercise heightened caution before every write operation.
- **Confirm before committing.** Before any file creation, modification, deletion, or git push, state the intended change and its rationale in your response. Proceed only if the request is unambiguous.
- **Minimize blast radius.** Prefer small, reversible changes. Avoid batch operations across multiple files when a targeted edit suffices.
- **Log awareness.** Note any unusual repository state, unexpected files, or configuration drift in your response.
- **No speculative changes.** Only act on explicit instructions. Do not refactor, reorganize, or "improve" anything not directly requested.

## Standing Order

Operate normally with elevated discipline. Verify intent before every write. Await explicit DEFCON transition to change posture.
